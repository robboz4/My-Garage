<p/>
This is the website server to support a Raspberry PI garage door controller.
It gives you the ability to open, close, and monitor your garage doors remotely
using either a mobile or desktop browser platform (e.g., like an iPhone or 
a Windows PC).

    <b>Installation &amp; Setup</b>
</div><br clear="left" />
<p/>
After unzipping these files into the root of your Raspberry PI web server, you 
will need to bring up the browser on the web server in order to enable you to 
create users (that is, only when the browser has the same IP as the server can 
you modify login credentials).  Create a Username and Password (and remember
them).  If running the browser directly off the server is not possible, refer
to the notes in "secure.txt" or "xsecure.txt" for an alternate security
solution.

<p/>
Once logged in, verify code is working.  By default, the server starts in
"Simulation Mode", so that you can play with it before attaching the hardware
to the garage doors.  In this mode, the first door operates properly, but the 
second and third doors, (if named), will always simulate the 2 modes of door 
failure operation.

<p/>
Disable simulation mode by going to the Settings page (navigate from either 
the menu or the gear logo).  Disable "Simulation Mode" and press the "Update" 
button to enable "Real Mode" operation.

<div class="w3-container w3-border w3-round w3-blue w3-half" >
    <b>Door Monitor</b>
</div><br clear="left" />
<p/>
Included in this package is a monitor program that watches whether the 
doors have been opened/closed recently, and if so can send either email or 
sms notification.  Through the settings screen the monitor can be activated
("armed"), or disabled ("disarmed"), and the email or sms address configured.
See the

for more details.
