secure.txt
The presence of this file enables remote account creation.

If this file exists, it allows a 1-time update of accounts (like at initial 
installation).  Once used the file is automatically renamed to "xsecure.txt" 
to prevent subsequent updates.

You can manually rename this file back to "secure.txt" to allow 1-time
account creation at a later time.
